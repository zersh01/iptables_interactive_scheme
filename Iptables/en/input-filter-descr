It is used for filtering packets, it is the default table.<br>

<ul><strong>ACCEPT</strong> — skipping the package. The packet leaves the current base chain and follows the flowchart further. 
Example opening ports 80 and 443: <br><br>

<code>iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dport 80,443 -j ACCEPT</code></ul>

<ul><strong>REJECT</strong> — block the package and inform its source about the rejection. 
By default, a failure is reported by sending an ICMP response packet "icmp-port-unreachable". 
However, this action supports the --reject-with option, which allows you to specify the wording
of the rejection message (possible values: icmp-net-unreachable, icmp-host-unreachable, icmp-proto-unreachable,
icmp-net-forbidden, icmp-host-forbidden). For the TCP protocol, rejection in the form of sending is supported 
RST packet (--reject-with tcp-reset).</ul>

<ul><strong>DROP</strong> — block the packet without informing the source about the failure. It is more preferable when filtering traffic on interfaces
connected to the Internet, as it reduces the informativeness of scanning host ports by attackers.</ul><br>

Also of some interest are the actions provided by the modules xtables-addons (currently this project is already included in Debian testing). 
Some of them are:

<ul><strong>STEAL</strong>— similar to DROP, but if used in the OUTPUT chain, when blocking an outgoing packet, it does not report an error to the application
that tried to send this packet.</ul>

<ul><strong>TARPIT</strong> — "suspend" the TCP connection. It is used only in the most extreme cases, for example, when fighting DoS attacks. 
Responds to an incoming connection, then reduces the frame size to zero, blocking the possibility of data transmission. 
The connection will "hang" in this state until the timeout on the attacking side expires (usually 20-30 minutes). 
At the same time, the attacking side's system resources (processor time and RAM) are spent on such a connection,
which can be very noticeable with a significant number of connections. If the TARPIT action is used correctly, 
the resources of the attacked party are practically not consumed.<br><br>

The correct application means the prevention of processing 
such connections are made by the conntrack subsystem, since otherwise the system resources of the attacked host itself will be consumed. 

For example, before adding a port blocking rule<br>
<pre>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j TARPIT</pre> 
be sure to add an appropriate rule to the raw table that prevents the processing of blocked connections by the conntrack subsystem: 
<pre>iptables -t raw -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 25 -j NOTRACK</pre> </ul>

<ul><strong>DELAY</strong> — create the appearance of an open TCP port. It responds to SYN packets with SYN/ACK packets, and RST responds to all other packets. 
Very useful for misleading an attacker scanning your host's ports.</ul>

<ul><strong>CHAOS</strong>— randomly select one of two actions for each new TCP connection. 
The first of them is REJECT, the second, depending on the selected option, is either TARPIT (--tarpit) or DELUDE (--delude). 
In particular, when using the CHAOS --delay action for all unused ports, an attacker scanning your ports 
it will receive completely incorrect information about the status of your ports. In the case of CHAOS --tarpit, 
the situation will also be aggravated by "hanging" connections.</ul>
